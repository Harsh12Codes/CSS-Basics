/*
    :root {
        --primary-variable   --> we can define custom variable using --sign
        we can use them like ----> var(--primary-variable)

        calc()  ----> function to calculate different arthmetic operation on units like 2px+2rem

        we should use these variable and calc() function to make our css more simplified

        PSEUDO SELECTORS

        pseudo selectors doesn't work if there is no content


        ::first-letter  ----> select first letter of content
        ::first-line    ------> select the first line of content

        ::before    -----> it comes before the element itself
        ::after     -----> it comes just after the element

        to have blank content: in before or after selector ----->  content:'';
        
        you can use attributes in pseudo selectors like content:attr(data-text);
